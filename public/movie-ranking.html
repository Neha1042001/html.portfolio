<h3>Article 370</h3>
<p>Article 370 of the Indian Constitution granted special autonomy to the region of Jammu and Kashmir, allowing it to have its own constitution, flag, and internal laws. It limited the Indian Parliament's powers in the state, except in matters of defense, foreign affairs, and communications. In August 2019, the Government of India revoked this special status, integrating Jammu and Kashmir more fully into India, sparking significant political debate and regional tensions.</p>
