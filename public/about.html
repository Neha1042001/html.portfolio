<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Neha Yadav, and I have a strong academic foundation in both biotechnology and bioinformatics. I completed my degree in biotechnology from RD National College, where I discovered my passion for understanding the complex mechanisms of biology. To further deepen my knowledge, I pursued a master's in bioinformatics from Patkar College, where I gained expertise in applying computational methods to biological data.</p>

  <p>One of my key accomplishments during my academic journey was developing a web application focused on celiac disease. This project allowed me to combine my scientific knowledge with my technical skills, using coding to address a real-world health issue. It reinforced my interest in bioinformatics and my commitment to finding innovative solutions in the field.</p>
  
  <p>I have always enjoyed coding, and I constantly seek new challenges that allow me to enhance my programming abilities. Whether working on personal projects or academic research, I am always excited to explore emerging technologies. Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy swimming, which helps me stay active and clear-minded. I am continuously looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully to the world of bioinformatics.</p>
